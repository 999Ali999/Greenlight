# 🟢 Greenlight | Still on going!

Greenlight is a comprehensive web application project that demonstrates clean and effective Go programming practices. It was designed as part of *Let's Go Further*, a book by Alex Edwards that focuses on building real-world applications using Go.

---

## 🚀 Overview

Greenlight is a learning-driven project aimed at developing a robust and scalable web application. This project integrates key concepts like user authentication, role-based access control, and the management of movies data, while adhering to Go's best practices.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Go (Golang)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Authentication**: Secure password hashing and role-based access control with **JWT**
- **Architecture**: Modular and scalable design using layered architecture
- **REST API**: Exposing JSON-based endpoints for easy integration

## 🎯 Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure user registration, login, and session management.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Different roles to manage access and permissions.
- **CRUD Operations**: Perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on movie data.
- **Validation**: Strong input validation to ensure data integrity.
- **Secure Practices**: Built-in password hashing, data validation, and secure headers.

## 📚 Learning Outcomes

The **Greenlight** project is an excellent opportunity to:
- Gain hands-on experience with Go’s built-in web development tools.
- Learn how to handle HTTP requests, manage routing, and work with middleware.
- Understand how to structure large Go applications for scalability and maintainability.
- Work with PostgreSQL in Go to manage data persistence.
- Implement secure and scalable user authentication and authorization systems.
